      <p class="text">Williams Omayuku is a <strong>full stack</strong> developer who honed his skills as a pure Node.JS developer - which is rather ironic, considering almost every JS developer tends to start from the front-end. With a Bachelor in Computer Science and a Master (in view) in Information Engineering, it can be said that a firm background in the fundamentals of IT and software Engineering have already been established.</p>
      <p class="text"> But enough about tech. Self-discovery is of utmost importance to me, as much as doing what I love, which is a lot; nature, paintings, photography come first, and then comes the unquenchable urge to satisfy the bowels, and finally, the ultimate need to burn off the acquired calories.</p>

      <h4 class="title is-3">What I hope to achieve:</h4>

        <li class="text">Have a cocktail on the sun.</li>
        <li class="text">Throw a barbecue party at the Mariana trench.</li>
        <li class="text">Bring Peace to the middle ****.</li>
